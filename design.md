# Natancy's Birthday Microsite - Design Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

**Emotional Intimacy**: Every element should feel handcrafted and deeply personal, as if created specifically for Natancy alone. The design should evoke the feeling of a private confession rather than a public celebration.

**Cinematic Romance**: Visual storytelling that creates emotional tension and release. Soft, dreamy aesthetics that feel like a beautiful dream or a romantic film scene.

**Sophisticated Femininity**: Elegant and refined without being childish or overly sweet. The aesthetic should feel mature, intentional, and emotionally intelligent.
